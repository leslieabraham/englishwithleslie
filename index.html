      <h2>Hi everyone!</h2>
      <p class="intro">My name is Leslie, I'm 28 years old from the Philippines but I have been living here in Russia for a year and a half now. In my home country, English is our official language which helps us to have more opportunities in life, as it is the language of international communication.</p>
      <p class="intro">Alright! Let's get to know each other. I'll start. What is my passion in life? I have such a passion for a lot of things and one of them is teaching. I have been teaching for several years and I am certified to teach English as a foreign language.</p>
      <p class="intro">I tailor each of my lessons based on my students' skills. Most importantly, I focus on integrating relevant topics into the lessons so that the students will be able to use them in daily conversations because I believe that the best way of learning English is for the students to speak as much as possible so that they will feel comfortable in using it in real-life settings. And to add to that, I know only a little to no Russian which means that the students will be immersed in an English-only environment during our lessons.</p>
      <p class="intro">In my free time, I enjoy doing other things that I love such as cycling(which is cool because I've actually only learned it here), running, trekking, going to the beach(oh how I miss the beach!), painting, handcrafting(anything artsy!), reading sci-fi or adventure books, and many more! I also love to pet cats and dogs.</p>
      <p class="intro">Now that you know a little about me, I can't wait to know more about you. Hope to see you soon!</p>

      <h3>Sofiya, 10 years old</h3>
      <p>Before I started English lessons with Leslie, it was difficult for me to talk to foreigners. I specifically chose her to help me because she speaks only English and that's why I quickly learned to speak. I liked the way she brought the information to me. Leslie conducts very interesting lessons, it's nice to take them. I'm still studying English with her and I feel comfortable talking to foreigners , I can express my thoughts well.</p>

      <h3>Yulia</h3>
      <p>Before I started English lessons with Leslie, I have little practice in English. I specifically chose her to help me because she doesn't speak Russian. She uses an individual approach  in the lessons. It will be good practice to learn English from her. Since sI have become more confident. ðŸ˜‡</p>
